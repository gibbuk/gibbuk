## About me
I'm a junior software engineer with [Digital Futures](https://digitalfutures.com/). I'm also a career changer making the change from directing complex digital solutions to building them. 

My most recent engineering deployment with Digital Futures was to a pioneering game, modelling and simulation start up. 

Prior to my employment with Digital Futures, I built my skills and confidence in software development through completion of their Academy programme.  I am proud to have made my career change as part of an organisation dedicated to diversity and inclusion.
  
## Technologies/experience
In my deployment I was part of an Agile engineering team with front and back end responsibilities to implement new features, changes and bug fixes. The front end was built using ReactJS, Redux and typescript. The backend with Typescript, Node, NestJS and ArangoDB.

Through the Digital Futures Academy I have experience in decomposing and analysing user stories in order to build Full Stack web applications, both independently and as part of Agile Scrum teams. I have used Domain Modelling, Test-Drive Design and Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure my code is clean, scalable and meets the requirements. Technologies include: JS, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, HTML/CSS and Java.

## Outside of coding
I'm a drummer, bmxer and gamer. I'm always looking to learn and push myself. This has led me to achieving silly things like writing a novel in a month and producing a short film in 48 hours.
