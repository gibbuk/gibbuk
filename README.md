## About me
I'm a trainee software engineer and career changer, making the change from directing complex digital solutions to building them. I am proud to have completed the intensive Software Engineering course with Digital Futures Academy, building my skills in software development and industry practices as part of an organisation dedicated to diversity and inclusion.
  
## Technologies/experience
Through the Digital Futures Academy I have experience in decomposing and analysing user stories in order to build Full Stack web applications, both independently and as part of Agile Scrum teams. I have used Domain Modelling, Test-Drive Design and Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure my code is clean, scalable and meets the requirements. Technologies include: JS, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, HTML/CSS and Java.

## Outside of coding
I'm a drummer, bmxer and gamer. I'm always looking to learn and push myself. This has led me to achieving silly things like writing a novel in a month (twice!).
